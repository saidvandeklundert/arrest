# ARREST
Asynchronous Rust Rest Client


Learning project. 

Work in progress.



Steps to using it:
1. Create structs that map to the API replies
2. Ensure you can initilize the structs to their zero value
3. Initialize the Arrest client
4. Pass a vector of URLs and the struct that maps to the reply to the `arrest` method
